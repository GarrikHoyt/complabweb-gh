Ava is a Population Health major in the Department of Population Health at the College of Health at Lehigh University.

Ava's current research focuses on modeling flu on Lehigh University's campus and developing a forecasting database for students/staff to use for prevention.
Ava's long-term goal is to learn more about disease epidemiology and improving access to healthcare. After graduation her goal is to pursue a Masters in Health Administration to improve health equity and outcomes in her community.
